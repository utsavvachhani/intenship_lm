* OTP Details:

  * Stored OTP with expiry (5–10 mins) using MongoDB or in-memory store (optional Redis).
  * Hashed OTP for security before saving in DB.
  * Used **nodemailer** for sending emails from a verified Gmail SMTP sender.

#### 🎯 **Frontend Flow:**

* Users input email → get OTP in email → input OTP → set new password.
* OTP inputs validated and submitted to backend for verification.
* Password reset form shown only after successful OTP check.

---

### 🛡️ **Admin Authentication Interface (Secure Key Based)**

#### ✅ **Admin Login Page (React + Tailwind/MUI)**

* Created a **separate admin login interface** with a secret key validation step.
* Frontend included:

  * Admin email + password + secret key field
  * Show error toast if invalid key or credentials
* Used `react-toastify` for error/success feedback.
* On successful admin login:

  * Redirected to admin dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)
  * Admin token saved and used for protected routes

#### 🔧 **Backend Logic:**

* Validated submitted secret key against `.env` config (`process.env.ADMIN_SECRET`).
* Differentiated admin vs. staff in JWT payload for route access control.
* Protected routes using a custom middleware (`adminAuth.js`).

---

### 📁 **Code & Architecture Enhancements**

* Created separate **auth controller**, **OTP utility**, and **email helper functions** for modularity.
* Defined clear API structure:

  ```
  /api/staff/
  ├── signup
  ├── signin
  ├── forgot-password
  ├── verify-otp
  └── reset-password

  /api/admin/
  ├── login
  └── dashboard (protected)
  ```

---

### 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

* Tested full auth flow via:

  * **Frontend UI forms**
  * **Postman API checks** for OTP and password flows
* Verified:

  * Expired OTP returns appropriate error
  * Secure password hashing via `bcryptjs`
  * Correct JWT payload for both staff and admin

📍 **Week 5 – Day 2**

### 🛠️ **Tasks & Explanations:**

---

### 🛒 **Category Creation & Bug Fixing**

* 🐛 **Resolved MongoDB Duplicate Key Error:**

  * Fixed the `E11000 duplicate key error` caused by a unique index on the `email` field in the `categories` collection.
  * Identified that the `email` field was either missing or being passed as `null`.
  * **Solution:** Removed or corrected the `email` field from schema or ensured it receives a valid value before inserting a new document.

* 🗂️ **Improved Category Schema Validation:**

  * Ensured that new category submissions require all mandatory fields: `categoriesName`, `description`, and `categoriesImage`.
  * Validated `parentCategories` against existing entries to avoid broken relationships.

* 🆕 **Successful Category Insertion:**

  * Implemented safe category addition via the backend API with proper MongoDB handling using Mongoose.
  * Added appropriate error handling and response messages to the controller.

## 🛠️ **Tasks & Progress Summary:**

---

### 👨‍💼 **Staff Management – Admin Approval Flow**

#### ✅ **Staff Creation from Staff Portal**

* Staff users can now **sign up** from the `staff-portal` with necessary details.
* All newly registered staff are saved with `isVerified: false` and status as `Pending`.

#### 🛡️ **Admin-Side Verification (UI + Logic)**

* Built a **dedicated admin UI panel** to view unverified staff.
* Admin can now:

  * View full staff details (profile image, name, role, message, etc.)
  * Approve or Reject staff directly from UI
  * Latest issued actions are shown with `Issued By`, `Action`, and admin details

#### 🔁 **Dynamic IssuedBy History Tracking**

* Updated **staff schema** to store a full `issuedBy` array with:

  * Admin ID (ref)
  * Action taken (Approved / Rejected)
  * Timestamp
* When actions are taken multiple times (approve → reject → approve), each is stored with history.

---

### 🗂️ **Category Management Improvements**

#### ✍️ **Staff-Added Categories (Pending State)**

* Staff can now submit **new category requests** from the staff portal.
* These are stored with `isVerified: false` and visible only to the admin for approval.

#### ✅ **Admin Review & Approval (UI + Backend)**

* Developed admin-side category approval UI similar to staff verification:

  * Grid view and Table view toggle (responsive with MUI)
  * Shows image, parent, createdBy, and issuedBy history
  * Admin can Approve / Reject categories
  * Actions stored in `issuedBy` field in category schema as well

---

### 🧱 **Admin Block UI Enhancements**

* Created fully functional and **responsive admin dashboard interface** for:

  * Reviewing pending staff and categories
  * Taking action with real-time status updates
  * Toast feedback on actions (approve/reject)
  * Table layout for quick bulk review, and grid layout for detail preview

## 🛠️ **Tasks & Progress Summary:**

### 🧩 **Admin Panel – Category Verification Enhancements**

#### 🎨 **UI Improvements for Category Review**

* Worked on refining the **Admin UI** for category approvals:

  * Enhanced the **table and grid view toggle** for smoother UX
  * Improved **visual hierarchy** using MUI components for better readability (color-coded status, action buttons)
  * Added **pagination and search filters** for managing large category lists
  * Implemented **real-time UI feedback** using `react-toastify` for approve/reject actions

#### ✉️ **Email Notifications for Category Submissions**

* Developed backend functionality to **notify staff** when their submitted category is:

  * **Approved**
  * **Rejected**
* Email content includes:

  * Category name, status, and any optional admin notes
  * Sent via **Nodemailer** using Gmail SMTP
* Created a **reusable email utility function** to handle different mail types (OTP, category status, etc.)

#### 🔧 **Backend Enhancements**

* Extended category schema to include:

  * `status` (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
  * `issuedBy[]` history with `adminId`, action, timestamp
* Improved category controller logic:

  * Admin actions trigger email notifications
  * Approval updates `isVerified` to `true`, rejection keeps it `false` and updates `status`

Got it! You want me to polish and expand your **Day 23** update with additional notes on:

* The final calls and logic in the **rejectCategories** and **approveCategories** backend functions
* Similar implementation for **rejectProducts** and **approveProducts**, mirroring staff verification logic
* How the admin side was improved for easier linking and state management (like using `useSelector` in React)
* Other improvements or refinements that make the system smoother and cleaner overall
